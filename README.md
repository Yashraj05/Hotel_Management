## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Hotel Booking Management Project is a software using which Hotel Managers can handle customer bookings with ease, and Customers can easily book Hotels at any location by sitting at home. 

So first Administrator will register and login into the system and after the login, he can add the Locations and All the Facilities which multiple Hotels can have. After this Admin can Register the Hotel into the application but before adding the Hotel, Admin has to register the Hotel Manager because when he adds the hotel he has to select the Hotel Manager who will manage the bookings. 

Now Since Admin has added the Hotels, so now Customers can book the hotels, but at first, the booking status will be Pending, since the customer has booked the hotel, so now Hotel Manager will be able to see all the customer bookings. 

The hotel Manager can update the booking status based on the Hotel Room Availability. The manager can Approve the Booking or Cancel the Booking. After this customer can see the updated Booking status. 

Customers can rate and review the Hotels out of 5, once review is added it will be visible to all.

In the end, Admin will be able to see the complete details like all customer bookings, all hotels, all customers, and all hotel managers.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

<h2> STEP 1 :- Set up the Live System:</h2>

- Obtain a server or hosting provider where you can deploy your project.
- Ensure the server meets the system requirements for running React JS, Spring Boot, and MySQL.
- Install the necessary software dependencies on the server, including Node.js, Java (for Spring Boot), and MySQL.

<h2>STEP 2 :- Build the React JS Frontend:</h2>

- In the root directory of your React project, run the following command to build the optimized production-ready version of your frontend:```npm run build```
- This will create a build folder containing the compiled and minified assets of your React project.

<h2> STEP 3 :-Configure and Serve the Frontend (React JS):</h2>

- Set up a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on the server to serve the static files of your React JS frontend.
- Configure the web server to point to the build folder generated in Step 2.
- Set up appropriate routing rules and configurations to handle frontend routes.

<h2>STEP 4 :-Test and Verify the Deployment:</h2>

- Access the live system URL in a web browser to ensure that the React JS frontend and Spring Boot backend are functioning correctly.
- Perform end-to-end testing on the live system to validate the complete functionality of the E-commerce Online Shopping Project.
- Monitor the logs and error reports to identify and resolve any issues that may arise during the live deployment.

<h2>STEP 5 :-Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) (Optional):</h2>

- Consider implementing CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD to automate the deployment process, allowing for continuous integration and deployment of updates to the live system.
